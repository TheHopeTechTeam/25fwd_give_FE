# Repository Structure & Working Notes

## What This Repo Is
- React 19 + TypeScript single-page flow scaffolded by Vite 6, focused on the `/CONFGIVE` donation form.
- Styling combines MUI components with a global SCSS reset (`src/common/scss/reset.scss`) and page-specific styles (`src/pages/Congive.scss`).
- Form state, validation, and submission logic live in `src/pages/Confgive.tsx`, which wires TapPay (via the global `TPDirect`) together with Apple/Google/Samsung Pay helpers and the credit-card fields.
- Routing is intentionally minimal: `/CONFGIVE` renders the donation experience, all other routes immediately redirect to `https://thehope.co/en/privacyterms`.

## Tech Stack & Tooling
- Build tool: Vite 6 (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm preview`).
- Language/runtime: React 19, TypeScript 5.7, JSX with the React 19 runtime.
- UI/tooling libraries: MUI, Emotion (`@emotion/styled`), `react-hook-form`, `react-router-dom@7`, `vite-plugin-environment` for injecting env vars, and Sass for styling.
- Linting: ESLint 9 (config in `eslint.config.js`).

## Key Modules To Know
- `src/main.tsx`: boots the React app, imports the global reset styles, and renders `<AppRouter />`.
- `src/Router.tsx`: defines the only route (`/CONFGIVE`) and redirects everything else to the external privacy terms; handy place to add future routes.
- `src/pages/Confgive.tsx`:
  - Initializes TapPay (`TPDirect.setupSDK`) from env vars and configures Apple/Google/Samsung Pay helpers on mount.
  - Uses `react-hook-form` with `ConfGiveProps` to manage fields such as amount, receipt info, attachments, and payment selection.
  - Chooses a default payment type based on user agent, keeps track of payment readiness states, and conditionally enables Pay buttons.
  - Delegates UI to child components: `CreditCard`, `ExchangeRate`, `PaymentSelect`, `Receipt`, `Upload`, `PayButton`, plus dialogs for alerts, notes, privacy policy, and success/failure states.
- Supporting components (`src/pages/*.tsx`): encapsulate individual dialogs, header, upload widget, etc., and should be reviewed when modifying UX for each step.
- `src/interface/confGiveProps.model.ts`: central type for the form; update it in sync with any new form fields.

## Environment & Secrets
Create a `.env` or `.env.local` at the repo root with the following keys (all strings):
```
VITE_TAPPAY_APP_ID=        # numeric ID from TapPay console
VITE_TAPPAY_APP_KEY=       # secret API key paired with the ID
VITE_APPLE_MERCHANT_ID=    # Apple Pay merchant identifier (e.g., merchant.com.example)
VITE_GOOGLE_MERCHANT_ID=   # Google Pay merchant ID
```
These are consumed in `src/pages/Confgive.tsx` during TapPay setup. Missing values will log an error and payment widgets will not initialize.

## Local Startup Cheat Sheet
1. **Prereqs**: Node 18.18+ (Vite 6 requirement) and pnpm 9 (run `corepack enable` once to use the bundled pnpm).
2. **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install` (uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
3. **Configure env**: add the `.env` file described above and keep secrets out of version control.
4. **Run the dev server**: `pnpm dev` → opens on http://localhost:5173 (or the next free port).
5. **Type-check / lint / build**:
   - `pnpm lint` for ESLint 9.
   - `pnpm build` for production assets (runs `tsc -b` first).
   - `pnpm preview` to sanity-check the production bundle locally.
